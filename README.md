# collaborative_recommendation_imdb

This is a training project to demonstrate the use of collaborative filter in a real world application.


Here we will be working on IMDB movie ratings dataset.

The goal over here is to create an algorithm which can easily and precisely predict which movie the user will enjoy and which movies the user will hate.

Given how the collaborative filtering works, this algorithm is really well suited for such an application.
In collaborative filtering systems; the user plays an active role.
For this system to work properly, first it needs a lot of active actors or sensors (or as in our case 'users').
Then we make smaller and finer groups of the actors based on their taste or "feature similarity".

Check Jupyter Notebook for code and description.




1. Where to start? Get the data.

     First we gather the data from a reputable source.
     After we have the dataset; we need to make some changes to it; if needed a few changes to the data structure; cleaning the data and such.
     Then we have to take out a test set; we will use this later to check how good our model is.
